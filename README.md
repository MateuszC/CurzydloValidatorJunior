## About the Project

The `CurzydloValidatorJunior.php` file contains a basic PHP class called `UserValidator`. It includes two methods:

- `validateEmail($email)`: A placeholder method to validate email addresses.
- `validatePassword($password)`: A placeholder method to validate passwords.

Currently, both methods always return `false`, meaning no input is considered valid yet. The project is intended to serve as a starting point for more advanced email and password validation logic.
